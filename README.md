# Data Quality

This lab guides students through assessing and improving data quality using:
1. **Great Expectations** for data validation.
2. **Cleanlab** for identifying label errors.

## 1. Great Expecations

Great Expectations (GX) is an open-source data validation framework that helps ensure data quality by defining, testing, and documenting expectations for datasets. It provides tools for profiling data, creating validation rules, and generating reports to maintain data integrity in pipelines.

To start working with it, navigate to the [Great Expectations Notebook](https://github.com/zubxxr/SOFE3980U-Lab5/blob/main/Great_Expectations.ipynb) and download it. This is a Google Colab Notebook, an interactive environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in the cloud without needing to set up anything on your local machine. 

Go through the notebook and follow the steps to install the necessary libraries, load the dataset, and set up data validation with Great Expectations. The notebook demonstrates the process of loading the UCI Adult dataset, defining data expectations, and validating those expectations against the dataset. The goal is to ensure that the data meets certain quality standards by checking whether specific column values fall within a defined range. Each step is explained in detail, guiding you through the installation, setup, and validation process. By the end of the notebook, you'll understand how to use Great Expectations for data validation and quality assurance in your own datasets.


### Task 1
- Download the [Great Expectations Task 1 Notebook]()
- Follow the instructions in there.
- In your report, explain the three expectations you used.
